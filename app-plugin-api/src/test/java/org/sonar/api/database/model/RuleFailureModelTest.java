  /**
   * this is a strange behavior with default Oracle settings...
   * <p/>
   * See SONAR-1073 :
   * Oracle uses as default the setting NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS=BYTE. In this case the character columns are created as
   * VARCHAR2(500) instead of VARCHAR2(500 CHAR). So the columns are created with a limitation of 500 single byte characters.
   * In UTF-8 some special characters need up to 6 single byte characters.
   * The problem is that Hibernate checks that the message does not exceed 500 Unicode characters.
